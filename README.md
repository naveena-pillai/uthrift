# bootcamp-final-project
-> Dormpop has a similar purpose to Depop, but is catered towards college students seeking access to more affordable resources. We look to not only bring the campus community together while providing an easy site to shop for your new college lifestyle.

-> With expensive campus stores and some packages that cannot be delivered, Dormpop seeks to have quick and easy access to resources with same day pickup, custom filtering to YOUR taste, and reasonable options. Dormpop is here to make your campus life optimal, featuring: clothing, accessories, dorm decorations and textbooks.

-> You have the choice to be a customer/buyer on the site, or a seller, you can switch between the two. As a buyer you will be able to scroll through products, look at your cart, filter for specific categories, see what products are popular, and checkout. As a seller you are able to view your profile and selling statistics, update prices (to increase or put them on sale), upload desctiptions of your clothes with photos, and add addresses.
