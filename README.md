*Your campus marketplace for affordable college essentials.*

Dormpop has a similar purpose to Depop, but is catered towards college students seeking access to more affordable resources. We bring your campus community together, making it easier than ever to shop or sell clothing, dorm decor, textbooks, and more while providing an easy site to shop for your new college lifestyle.

## Features 
**Curated for College Students:** Affordable essentials like clothing, accessories, dorm decorations, and textbooks.

**Same-Day Pickup:** Skip the expensive campus store and get what you need fast.

**Custom Filtering:** Find exactly what you want based on category.

**Dual Roles:** Create an account based on whether you'd like to be a buyer or a seller.

   **Buyers:** Browse products, add items to your cart, filter by category, view popular items, and checkout.
